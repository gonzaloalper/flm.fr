# flm.fr

Code intended to implement a goodness-of-fit test for regression on Principal Components (PCs) for the Functional Linear Model (FLM) with Functional Response.

- data-flm-fr: examples of functional data with functional response.
- fregre.lr.pc.ex: example of regression on PCs for the FLM with functional response.

The R directory contains exclusively .R functions, such as:

- fpc: PCA for functional data.
- fregre.fr.pc: regression on PCs for the FLM with functional response.
- fregre.sr.pc: regression on PCs for the FLM with scalar response.
- pseudoinverse: computes a pseudo-inverse by means of a singular value decompsoition (SVD).
